* Changes in ESATWifi 2.2, 2021-02-11

** There are new on-demand WLAN, network  and transport telemetries.

** Now static IP mode is supported.

** A standalone self-processing telecommands and radio telemetry 
delivery mode is available for debugging purposes.

** The telemetry enable value is persistent beyond power resets for
packets with number > 0 (0 always start enabled).


* Changes in ESATWifi 2.1.1, 2019-04-30

** This release fixes a crash on telemetry queue resets triggered
during network operations.


* Changes in ESATWifi 2.1.0, 2018-10-24

** This release fixes a packet loss problem when receiving packet
from the ground station and the on-board computer simultaneously
is fixed.

** The library doesn't produce compiler warnings anymore.

** Some textual errors have been fixed.

** The README file explains the code organisation.

** All computer code files have copyright notices.

** The main program shows the program name and version in the header.

** The complexity of passing around CCSDS Space Packets in KISS frames
has been reduced with the help of new modules from ESATUtil.

** The radio connection with the ground segment server is in a
separate module.

** There are separate modules for telecommands.

** Users can add new telecommands from the Arduino sketch.

** The ESAT Wifi board can produce telemetry packets.

** There is a new telemetry packet that reports the connection state.

** Users can add new telemetry packets from the Arduino sketch.

** The minimum required version of ESATUtil is 2.1.0.


* Changes in ESATWifi 2.0.0, 2017-11-08

** Telemetry and telecommand packets are CCSDS Space Packets.

** Packets are passed around in KISS frames.

** Module configuration is commanded with telecommand packets.

** The format for storing the configuration has changed.

** General purpose input/output pin number 0 is used to signal that
the module is connected or not connected to the ground segment server.

** The code is divided in a library with two modules and a main
program.

** There is a new dependency: ESATUtil 2.0.0.
