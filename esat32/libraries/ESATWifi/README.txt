ESAT Wifi library version 2.2.0

Wifi communications subsystem for ESAT.

This software runs in the ESAT Wifi board.  Use it with Arduino 1.8.0
or newer together with the Arduino core for ESP8266-based boards
(esp8266) 2.3.0 or a newer 2.x.y version and the ESAT utility library
(ESATUtil) version 2.1.0 or a newer 2.x.y version.  Use Generic
ESP8266 Module as the target board.

See the example Wifi program (examples/Wifi/Wifi.ino).  This program
uses the modules of the Wifi library.

The src/ directory contains the Wifi library (ESAT_Wifi) as well as
several subdirectories:


# ESAT_Wifi

This is the main library that provides the Wifi communications
functionality.


# ESAT_Wifi-peripherals directory

Peripherals of the ESAT Wifi board.


# ESAT_Wifi-telecommands directory

Telecommands of the ESAT Wifi board.


# ESAT_Wifi-telemetry directory

Telemetry packets of the ESAT Wifi board.
