// Space Packet Protocol.  They contain a 6-byte primary header
// followed by a series of octets (at least 1) with the packet data.

// the most significant, the last byte is the least significant.
// Signed integers are stored in two's complement format.
// Floating-point numbers are stored in IEEE 754 format.
// The packet data can be read and written as a Stream.
