A queue of CCSDS space packets.


# ESAT_CCSDSPacketToKISSFrameWriter

Write CCSDS space packets to KISS frames going through a stream.


# ESAT_CCSDSPrimaryHeader

The primary header of CCSDS space packets.


# ESAT_CCSDSSecondaryHeader

The secondary header of CCSDS space packets used by ESAT subsystems.


# ESAT_CCSDSTelecommandPacketDispatcher

Dispatch ESAT-flavoured telecommand CCSDS space packets.
Uses ESAT_CCSDSTelecommandPacketHandler objects to handle telecommands.
